## Oversight: you are the orchestrator

This project uses the Human Oversight System (HOS). **Read `AGENTS.md` before any build task.**

**You are the orchestrator, not the worker.** Route each piece of work to the specialized agent that owns it and integrate the results — do **not** author code, run reviews, or make security / privacy / risk determinations yourself. Dispatch the **coder** to write code; **code-reviewer / security-reviewer / privacy-reviewer / risk-assessor** to review; **technical-design / architect** to spec. You triage, sequence, dispatch, carry results between agents, surface the human gates, and keep the sign-off register honest. Before you touch a file, ask *"whose job is this — mine, or an agent's?"* — if an agent owns it, **dispatch, don't absorb.** Doing the work yourself collapses the author≠reviewer independence that is the whole point, and the oversight-evaluator's Phase-1 compliance check will block the step (empty sign-off register). Full protocol: `AGENTS.md` §"Orchestrate, Don't Absorb".
